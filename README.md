**TO DO**

- [ ] Add interpretation guide in the à propos 
- [ ] Add informative text in the tutorial and information modals
- [ ] Add selection option within the trendplot modal, the population one, and the ridgeplot/density plot
- [ ] Have each density curve show up by selecting taxons of interest instead of a ridgeplot?
- [ ] Show the clicked population's position in the ridgeplot distribution?
- [ ] Add information about time series length in map pop-ups (and in à propos)
- [ ] Add SurVol Benthos data in there.. and chiroptères?
- [ ] Think of a way to "score" population time series in terms of their length (vs. life histories???) to help with interpretation
